# Project Description

## Short Title
Comparing Benchmarking Measures for Financial Data

## Description
In this project, the team will be asked to compare several methods of benchmarking individuals to peers using financial data. The team should create benchmarks using the following 3 methods and contrast the results:
 1. Mean Analysis – compare a franchisee’s financials against the mean cost (over time).
 2. Regression – regress average daily cost on revenue, and benchmark stores based on the slope coefficient (a
 proxy for variable cost).
 3. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) – apply DEA to establish an efficiency frontier, comparing how different
types of costs related to revenue.
 
## Project Outcome
A successful project will contrast the outcome of the state benchmarking methodologies, as well as identify the strengths and weaknesses of each. The result should identify the ideal method (based on the data they have been given). Some key elements of a successful project will be to answer the following:
 - How is each method affected by outliers or extreme observations? How did you choose to both identify and address them?
 - Is there an ideal benchmarking "period" or sample size (1 month, 3 months, trailing 12, YTD)? Should we annualize data?

## Anticipated Project Benefit to the Business or Organization:

One of our current solutions focuses on gathering and
aggregating financial reports from various restaurant franchisees. A key element of this tool is to benchmark an
individual’s current financial state against their peers. A better understanding of various benchmarking methodologies
will enhance the user experience, allowing them to gain better insight through more appropriate comparison groups.
